            Interior design <br> as you always wanted.
        </h1>
        <p>
            We developed a diverse and extensive international experience working on both small and large scale hospitality projects, from
            private residential homes to complex detailed packages. Our approach is multidisciplinary and covers all aspects of a project,
            from interior architecture to furniture design and from concept stage through to construction.
            <br><br>
            To further our prior interest in luxury hospitality interior design, we started research projects to discover solutions in
            ecological and sustainable manners which highlight smart solutions by efficient property development. This curiousity led us to
            establish the interior design studio BBMichaels. Where with our partners we cover visual identity, architecture and interior
            design, production and project management.
            <br><br>
            We believe luxury details can be formed through functionality with a subtle touch of communicating cultural aspects.
